# ForPeopleByPeople

1.1 Overview and Motivation :
Often we are restricted in helping each other by the availability of data, which is either present and we are not aware of it or its not viable. People are in need and there is an abundance of resources available to them, but they may not have the proper access to know of such resources when they need assistance. Often users rely on word or mouth, previous experience , or search endlessly on the internet. We have recognized the need for people to be able to gather the right information and get to the help they need. We want to provide them with the ability to bridge data and technology for whenever they need assistance or want to help others.
ForPeople-ByPeople application will help in resolving the problems by providing people with access to information and/or resources for when they are in need of food, shelter, clothing, education etc. and not aware from where to seek help. This would remedy users going to the wrong resources and wasting time for when they need help and decrease discouragement when seeking out help. This computing application may not stop people’s needs, but it can get them to someone who can assist them faster and a more efficient way.
The main motivation behind this application is a social cause of providing common platform to help people, by people. People in need are not able to connect to the people who want to help and the vice versa, there are various variables that play a part here like accurate data, transportation, accessibility of the available solutions, etc. We as a team have come up with a design to bridge the gap between people in need and people who can suffice the need and also include all latest technology possible in bringing the best solution out of it.
